# Canadian-Weather-Data
Pulls monthly weather data for a specified Canadian province and stores yearly averages in a database.

I thought this would be a fun little project to work on and gain some experience with new python libraries along the way. I didn't initially intend to make it public so some variable names may appear random and some sections may be uncommented. A small part of the code was inspired by another open source project with a similar goal but I genuinely forgot where I found it.
