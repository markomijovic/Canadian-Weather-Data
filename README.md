# Canadian-Weather-Data
Pulls monthly weather data for a specified Canadian province and stores yearly averages in a database.

I thought this would be a fun little project to work on and gain some experience with new python libraries along the way. I didn't initially intend to make it public so some variable names may appear random and some sections may be uncommented. A small part of the code was inspired by another open source project with a similar goal but I genuinely forgot where I found it. 

To run the code, run main.py from the CMD.

By default, it will download 15 pages (all the stations) in Alberta, if you want another province just change 'AB' and manually see what is the maximum #of pages for that province and change 15 to that.
